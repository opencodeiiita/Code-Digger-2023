protein from all food other than chicken eggs and paneer=30g
and protein through eggs=6*no.of eggs
                    chicken=(gms of chicken)*30/100
                    paneer=(gms of paneer)*20/100

and protein need=1.2*Weight of Aditya

so 30+protein through eggs+chicken+paneer should be >= protein need of Aditya
