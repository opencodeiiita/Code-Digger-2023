Aditya wants to build body now, so he has to meet daily protein intake to progress in the gym in order to build muscle

Only sources of protein for Aditya is Eggs, chicken and paneer
he consumes each or some or neither of them in a day
Additionally, consider through his other daily roti-sabji-dal-chawal (ie regular diet) he his consuming 30 g protein daily by default

Given data of no.of eggs, grams of chicken and grams of paneer eaten each day find if he is meeting his daily protein needs or not.

Information: Each egg has 6 g protein
             100 g chicken has 30 g protein
             100 g paneer has 20 g protein
   min Protein need of a male person (willing to build muscle)= 1.2g per kg of body weight

Input: 
first line contains t , the no. of test cases
second line contains W, weight of Aditya
third line contains 3 inputs e, c, and p denoting no. of eggs, grams of chicken and grams of paneer consumed in a day by him

Output:
Only line of ouput should print "YES" if he meets his daily protein needs and "NO" if he doesn't, 


Constraint:
1<=t<=10
50<=W<=200
Aditya can't have more than this in a day:
0<=e<=10
0<=c<=200
0<=p<=200
