                                                ABHI'S STRING
                                                
Abhi was observing some set of strings.He have found a string s having n lowercase English alphabets, and he wants to make 
it as short as possible. To do this, he can remove any pair of adjacent char's from s desired numbers of times,but they should not 
be same. Suppose, we take a string "jhalwaachhowk", then we can get jhalwachowk,jhalwaachkmjhalwaacho,jlwaachowk,etc. But one 
cannot get jhalwchowk or jhalwacowk because the removed characters were "aa" and "hh" that are identical respectively. 
What is the minimum length Abhi can achieve by applying any number of deletions?

INPUT:
The first line of the input contains a single integer t s.t 1<=t<=10^4 — the number of test cases. Descriptions of the test cases 
follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n s.t 1<=n<= 2*10^5 — the length of the string s.
The second line of each test case contains the string s consisting of n lowercase English letters.
*Sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 2*10^5.

OUTPUT
For each test case, output a single number - the minimum length of the string s, after removing pairs of adjacent characters with 
different values.
