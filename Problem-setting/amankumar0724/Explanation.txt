Suppose there is a string of length n,(taking worse case) all char's are same.
If any character occurs more than n/2 times then resulting string will consist only of that character brecause only one time
occurrence is removed by one time deletion. 
So, in order to minimize the number of these char's we can only remove one occurrence at a time.We can always do this unless until 
we are remaining with such a character. In other cases we have to remove all possible pairs.
