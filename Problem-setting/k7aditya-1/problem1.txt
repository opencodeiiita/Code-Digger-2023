How many does to lose weight

Aditya is a fat boy and he has decided to finally lose weight now, but he is too lazy to exercise or do any kind of physical activity other than his daily work.
So he has decided to lose his weight by creating a calorie deficit,

But, Aditya can't measure his progress due to unavailibility of a weighing scale, but he has enough knowledge to know calories in a given food item, 
so he read some articles on the internet and concluded that-
for every 1 kg weight loss, he needs to create a overall 7000 calories deficit .

ASSUMPTION: Assume Daily requirement of every male person is 2500 cal in a day
            Assume no error in calorie measurements
            Assume daily calorie requirement doesnt change with weight
Calorie Deficit: If Aditya eats 1500 cal in a particular day then it is a 2500-1500 ie 1000 cal Deficit.

Aditya has started dieting n days ago, and is noting the total calorie intake of every day,
given the calorie intake for past x days, find how much weight Aditya has lost till date.

Input:
first line contains one integer t the number of test cases
second line contains one integer n - days past since Aditya is dieting
third line contains an array calories of size n, whre  calories[i] display calories consumed on ith day

Output:
Output in a single line weight lost by Aditya in kgs in the past n days.(output can be negative if he overconsumes caloriesie weight gain)


Constraints:
1<=t<=10
1<=n<=365
1<=calories[i]<=7000
