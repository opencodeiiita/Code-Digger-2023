Samrat loves maths. Ritesh has presented in front of him the given challenge:
Consider the set of natural numbers S = [1,2,3...N]. Samrat needs to create two subsets P & Q from the set S while following all the below given rules:
1) Set P & Q can contain between 0 to N elements each.
2) There exists no common elements between P & Q (P,Q are disjoint).
3) Subset P & Q together might or might not contain all elements of S.
4) Order of subsets don't matter. Eg, P = {1,2}, Q = {3} is same as P = {3}, Q = {1,2}.

Given N, find the no. of different pairs of subsets (P,Q) he can create.
Samrat is facing trouble while solving this question. He has requested you to help him solve the question.

Constraints:
1<=t<=1e6
1<=N<=1e5
The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3*1e5.

Input Format:
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing an integer N.

Output Format:
For each test case, output a positive number X, the no. of different pairs of subsets P,Q he can create. Since the value of X can be quite large, output X modulo 10^9+7.
