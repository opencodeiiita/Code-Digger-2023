Let P and Q be disjoint subsets of S
Now for any element i which belongs to S, following cases are possible
1) i belongs to P, but not to Q
2) i belongs to Q, but not to P
3) i belongs to neither P nor Q.

So, For every element there are 3 options, there are N such elements.
Total options = 3^N.
Here, P ≠ Q, except when P = Q = ϕ.
So, 3^N-1 ordered pairs (P, Q) are there for which P ≠ Q.
Hence total number of unordered pairs of disjoint subsets where P ≠ Q is (3^N - 1)/2.
Adding the subset pair P = Q = ϕ,
Required Answer = ((3^N - 1)/2) + 1.

Important Note:
Since 3^N is a very large no. for large values of N, pow function cannot be directly used as pow(3,n) cannot be type converted to int. Thus, manually powers are computed, and extensive use of modular arithmetic is required. Modular multiplicative inverse of 2 is given for ease of calculation.
